# Community of practice

People cycle in and out.
How does this dissertation project pave the way of building a community,
such that it scales to multiple instructors, and grows with learner's needs.

The Carpentries is only one way to keep a core set of materials up-to-date,
but what about other semester long classes?

At the university (Virginia Tech),
there are already existing programs such as SAGE (statistics) and
DataBridge (Library) that serve as a resource for researchers to get
help with data work,

- How do we take these data science meetup communities,
and apply them to a undergraduate university setting?
