## Module 1: Introduction to Spreadsheets

Working with data stored in spreadsheets and identifying when spreadsheets are useful and what a "clean" spreadsheet looks like.

Adapted and inspired by the
[Data Carpentry spreadsheet lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/)

### Module Learning Objectives

3. Identify when spreadsheets are useful
4. Assess when a task should not be done in a spreadsheet software

### Exercise 1

You are one of the researchers assigned to a
pharmacokinetics study of a phase 3 clinical trial for
Hepatitis C.
You have 3 patients who need to have their blood drawn and various vitals recorded:

1. **Gemma Dunn**: Blood drawn at **8am**; Heart rate **65bpm**; Respiratory rate: **12bpm**; Blood pressure **128/78 mmHg**; Pulse Ox **98%**; Temperature **96.8F**
2. **Priscilla Holding**: Blood drawn at **8:20am**; Heart rate **75bpm**; Respiratory rate: **18bpm**; Blood pressure **130/85 mmHg**; Pulse Ox **95%**; Temperature **97.0F**
3. **Aniya Warner**:  Blood drawn at **8:40am**; Heart rate **63bpm**; Respiratory rate: **13bpm**; Blood pressure **115/73 mmHg**; Pulse Ox **98%**; Temperature **96.5F**

How would you input these values into a spreadsheet?

#### Examples student solutions:

##### Input values without units

Units might be understood and assumed

| Name              | Time | Blood Pressure | Heart Rate | Respiratory Rate | Pulse Ox | Temperature |
|-------------------|------|----------------|------------|------------------|----------|-------------|
| Gemma Dunn        | 8:00 | 128/78         | 65         | 12               | 98       | 96.8        |
| Priscilla Holding | 8:20 | 130/85         | 75         | 18               | 95       | 97.0        |
| Aniya Warner      | 8:40 | 115/73         | 63         | 13               | 98       | 96.5        |

##### Add units to values

| Name              | Time   | Blood Pressure | Heart Rate | Respiratory Rate | Pulse Ox | Temperature |
|-------------------|--------|----------------|------------|------------------|----------|-------------|
| Gemma Dunn        | 8:00am | 128/78         | 65         | 12               | 98%      | 96.8F       |
| Priscilla Holding | 8:20am | 130/85         | 75         | 18               | 95%      | 97.0F       |
| Aniya Warner      | 8:40am | 115/73         | 63         | 13               | 98%      | 96.5F       |

##### Split names into 2 columns

| First Name | Last Name | Time   | Blood Pressure | Heart Rate | Respiratory Rate | Pulse Ox | Temperature |
|------------|-----------|--------|----------------|------------|------------------|----------|-------------|
| Gemma      | Dunn      | 8:00am | 128/78         | 65         | 12               | 98       | 96.8F       |
| Priscilla  | Holding   | 8:20am | 130/85         | 75         | 18               | 95       | 97.0F       |
| Aniya      | Warner    | 8:40am | 115/73         | 63         | 13               | 98       | 96.5F       |

##### Placing unit information in the columns

| First Name | Last Name | Time   | Blood Pressure (bpm) | Heart Rate (bpm) | Respiratory Rate (bpm) | Pulse Ox (%) | Temperature (F) |
|------------|-----------|--------|----------------------|------------------|------------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Gemma      | Dunn      | 8:00am | 128/78               | 65               | 12                     | 98           | 96.8F           |
| Priscilla  | Holding   | 8:20am | 130/85               | 75               | 18                     | 95           | 97.0F           |
| Aniya      | Warner    | 8:40am | 115/73               | 63               | 13                     | 98           | 96.5F           |

##### More correct

| first_name | last_name | time | diastolic | systolic | heart_rate | respiratory_rate | pulse_ox | temperature | temperature_unit |
|------------|-----------|------|-----------|----------|------------|------------------|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Gemma      | Dunn      | 8:00 | 128       | 78       | 65         | 12               | 98       | 96.8        | F                |
| Priscilla  | Holding   | 8:20 | 130       | 85       | 75         | 18               | 95       | 97.0        | F                |
| Aniya      | Warner    | 8:40 | 115       | 73       | 63         | 13               | 98       | 96.5        | F                |

### Exercise 2

Now, let's say you performed these tasks multiple times over the course of 72 hours.
You know at the end of the PK study, you want to be able to look to see if there were any drastic changes to the patient's vitals.
Here's a sample of more data,
does knowing what you want to look at

Example additional reading 1:

Taken on same day

1. **Gemma Dunn**: Blood drawn at **8am**; Heart rate **65bpm**; Respiratory rate: **12bpm**; Blood pressure **128/78 mmHg**; Pulse Ox **98%**; Temperature **96.8F**
2. **Priscilla Holding**: Blood drawn at **8:20am**; Heart rate **75bpm**; Respiratory rate: **18bpm**; Blood pressure **130/85 mmHg**; Pulse Ox **95%**; Temperature **97.0F**
3. **Aniya Warner**:  Blood drawn at **8:40am**; Heart rate **63bpm**; Respiratory rate: **13bpm**; Blood pressure **115/73 mmHg**; Pulse Ox **98%**; Temperature **96.5F**

Example additional reading 2:

Taken on the next day

1. **Gemma Dunn**: Blood drawn at **8am**; Heart rate **65bpm**; Respiratory rate: **12bpm**; Blood pressure **128/78 mmHg**; Pulse Ox **98%**; Temperature **96.8F**
2. **Priscilla Holding**: Blood drawn at **8:20am**; Heart rate **75bpm**; Respiratory rate: **18bpm**; Blood pressure **130/85 mmHg**; Pulse Ox **95%**; Temperature **97.0F**
3. **Aniya Warner**:  Blood drawn at **8:40am**; Heart rate **127bpm**; Respiratory rate: **36bpm**; Blood pressure **115/73 mmHg**; Pulse Ox **98%**; Temperature **96.5F**

#### Examples student solutions:

General solutions to entering these data points.
Do they keep everything in a separate file?
A separate sheet?
Are they adding rows or are they adding columns?

### Exercise 3

The protocol asks to report an adverse event if any of the patient's vitals
become abnormally elevated. How do you mark any abnormal observations?

#### Examples student solutions:

##### Color code values

##### Writing an excel conditional check

##### Manually labeling a column(s)

##### Comments of bad columns in a column

### Exercise 4

During the examination you ask the patient if they are feeling any discomfort and
why they are breathing so heavily,
and they tell you they were stretching and doing yoga poses to "get the blood moving".
How do you document this in your data?

#### Examples student solutions:

##### Free text column of "notes"

### Objective

Create a dataset from a data collection scenario that will be used as the
example to identify potential data formatting issues in spreadsheets.

#### Things to watch out for

As the first exercise of the workshop,
you need to be careful about calling out students and their "wrong" answers.
Chances are they are already intimidated by a data/programming class,
and we do not want to add further injury by calling out their responses.

#### How to overcome this

Talk about the set of possible "wrong responses" to introduce
formatting issues in spreadsheets,
and have a poll asking if the students' mock spreadsheet data
had at least one of the mentioned formatting issues.
Also, this drives the point of spreadsheets are great for manual data collection,
and as long as there is a **plan** to process the data then it's okay to make
the data collection part as easy as possible.
