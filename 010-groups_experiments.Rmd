# Overall Groups and Questions

## Sample groups

1. Workshop attendees where the main population of learners are coming from a medical background.
    1. [Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC](https://research.vtc.vt.edu/)
        - Fall 2020: iTHRIV scholars (n = 2)
        - FBRI faculty members
    2. [Roanoke Higher Education Center](https://www.education.edu/)
        - Fall 2020: Healthcare workshop series (n = 9)
2. Workshop attendees where the main population of learners are students (undergraduate/graduate)
    1. Undergraduate/graduate Carpentries-inspired class
        - Fall 2020
    2. Students from small modules taught as a part of a university course


- Workshop attendees (this will be a series of convenience samples)
    - What are potential issues and biases with this sample?
- Population will be self-selecting and more likely to be self-motivated
    - Individuals will need to register to attend the workshop or class

## Research Question

What is my actual research question?

1. What are the hurdles biomedical/medical professionals have
  with regards to using data for decision making and/or research?
    - Approach this problem from "first principles"
        - They have a question but do not know how to get the data needed
        - They have the data but do not know where to start
    - "The Democratization of Data Science Education"

## Hypothesis

These need to be targeted towards learning objectives.

1. Hypothesis: In-person workshops will help medical professionals curate better for research
2. Hypothesis: In-person workshops will help medical professionals work with data outside of a spreadsheet program
3. Hypothesis: Workshops with an eye towards tidy data principles will better transition students out of a spreadsheet program into programming
4. Hypothesis: Learning how to program data analysis will allow learners to feel like they can do more with their data

## Approach

1. Create learner personas
    1. identifying learning objectives
    2. Assessments
        - This will identify whether learning objectives are met
        - Will provide concrete examples and data for personas, so they do not become a list of sterotypes
        1. Student self assessment
            - Self assessment will help identify the various personas
        2. Student pre-workshop assessment
        3. Student post-workshop assessment
        4. Student long-term assessment (6 months)
