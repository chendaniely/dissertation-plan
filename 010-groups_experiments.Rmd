2. Workshop attendees where the main population of learners are students (undergraduate/graduate)

3. Lessons taught at as a university course
  - Small modules taught as a part of a university course

## Experiments

1. Hypothesis: In-person workshops will help medical professionals curate better for research
2. Hypothesis: In-person workshops will help medical professionals work with data outside of a spreadsheet program
3. Hypothesis: Workshops with an eye towards tidy data principles will better transition students out of a spreadsheet program into programming
4. Hypothesis: Learning how to program data analysis will allow learners to feel like they can do more with their data
