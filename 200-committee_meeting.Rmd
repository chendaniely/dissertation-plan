### Deliverables

![](./images/cc-by.png){height=100px}
![](./images/cc-zero.png){height=100px}

1. Identify and create learner personas for the biomedical community
2. Create a set of CC-0 lessons for the biomedical community
    - Carpentries-inspired
    - Carpenties Incubator: Data Science for Practicing Clinicians
        - https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/Data-Science-for-Docs/
        - Too much emphasis on Medical Doctors

### Phases + research questions

- IRB 20-537: Data Science Workshops for Biomedical and Health Professionals: Persona Identification and Workshop Assessment

1. Pre-workshop student self assessment survey to create learner personas
    - https://github.com/chendaniely/dissertation-irb/blob/master/irb-20-537-data_science_workshops/survey-01-pre_workshop_self_assessment.pdf
2. Pre/post workshop survey to assess the workshop materials
3. Long-term workshop survey (6 months out) to see if the materials helped with fundamental knowledge to learn more on their own

#### Research questions

3 main questions:

1. Does the biomedical community have different types of learners? How will their needs differ in the creation of learning and training materials?
    - Phase 1 questionnaire will go through validity and respondent clustering to identify personas
2. Does having interactive feedback with informative error messages in formative and summative assessment questions improve the learner's ability to learn and keep learning?
    - Using tools like {learnr} with the {gradethis} and {pygradethis} library to create training materials.
    - Pre/post workshop surveys can confirm existing knowledge along with results from the interactive questions in the workshop.
3. Does tailored workshop materials help learners retain knowledge, use the tools, and continue self-learning?
    - Combining all the surveys to determine "efficacy"
    
In more detail:

1. Creating learner personas will create better educational content because they will be more tailored to the needs of the students.
2. Learning how to program data analysis will allow learners to feel like they can do more with their data.
3. Learning basic data literacy and data science skills can empower health/biomed workers and be more proactive in making more educated decisions.
4. Workshops with an eye towards tidy data principles will better transition students out of a spreadsheet program into programming.
5. Workshops will help medical professionals curate better data for research.
6. Workshops will help medical professionals work with data outside of a spreadsheet program.

#### What is "effective"?

Learning objectives:

1. Name the features of a tidy/clean dataset
2. Transform data for analysis
3. Identify when spreadsheets are useful
4. Assess when a task should not be done in a spreadsheet software
5. Break down data processing into smaller individual (and more manageable) steps
6. Construct a plot and table for exploratory data analysis
7. Build a data processing pipeline that can be used in multiple programs
8. Calculate, interpret, and communicate an appropriate statistical analysis of the data

#### Samples

Snowball sample from relavant listservs on campus

1. Dennie Munson -- igep
2. Taryn Luoma (taryn1@vtc.vt.edu) -- fbri + iThriv
3. Nathaniel Porter (ndporter@vt.edu) -- swc tmbh students (n=3?)
4. Andrea Green (greena15@exchange.vt.edu) vetmed
5. Hannah Menefee (hmenefee@vt.edu) -- mph

### Preliminary results

#### 1-way statistics

**TODO INSERT FIGURES**

![](./images/results/likert.png)

1. **A LOT** of Excel
    - Very basic usage
    - Do not use other specialized software for tasks, mainly just Excel
2. No knowledge of "tidy data"
    - Fundamental to processing and cleaning data

#### Personas

![](./images/results/dendogram.png)

- Dendogram shows 3 or 5 groups
- Groups in sequential order is suspicious
    - Seems to be from when the surveys were sent out to the listservs

#### Creating Personas

- Through the Eyes of Faculty: Using Personas as a Tool for Learner-Centered Professional Development
    - https://www.lifescied.org/doi/10.1187/cbe.19-06-0114
    
- methods that combine hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis with chi-square values or squared Euclidian distance values and complete or average linkage
