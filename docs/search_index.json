Cooper created and introduced persona methodology to the product design industry to overcome the problem of designs that worked optimally for designers but were ill suited for the user base (Cooper, 1999; Pruitt and Adlin, 2006) Persona methodology draws from ethnography to describe how consumers use products in everyday contexts. Persona methodology also combats a second issue in the product design field: user reports that are informative but too lengthy, detailed, and cumbersome (Pruitt and Adlin, 2006). In contrast, personas communicate user information in robust, compact, easily digestible ways that are engaging. Personas also increase the memorability of data, because they provide characters, similar to the characters in a story (Denning, 2002; Grudin and Pruitt, 2002; Pruitt and Adlin, 2006). Persona methodology personas could capture the key discriminating features found across a large number of instructors. personas could be concrete tools that change agents can refer to during PD planning and implementation. by virtue of communicating information through a fictional human character, personas could evoke empathy in PD providers, a critical element if we intend to create a shared vision of education (Henderson and Dancy, 2011) Learners are different, and any one-size-fits-all approach is likely to have significant limitations. Reflection can sensitize facilitators to the variety of instructors they may be working with and help them prepare to respond. We do not envision personas as a diagnostic tool personas as a way to bring awareness and attention to the diversity that exists in PD settings and to help facilitators side with their own instructors and recognize what they bring to the table personas are fictional characters and should be treated as such. The personas are based on data, manifested in a humanistic form for ease of conveying information. As such, personas should be interpreted similarly to tables, graphs, and other data representations found in the literature 2.1 Personas Definitions (from rstudio learner personas): https://rstudio-education.github.io/learner-personas/ Novice: someone who doesn’t yet have a mental model of some field: as a result, they don’t know what they don’t know. Competent: they know enough to perform routine tasks without heroic effort Expert: if they are able to solve common problems at a glance and harder or more unusual problems reliably. Need: researcher who is domain(expert), stats(novice), programming(expert), data(competent) 2.2 Persona backstories From rstudio personas: general background relevant prior knowledge or experience the learner’s perception of their needs any special considerations 2.3 Self-assessment results The colors from the dendograms need to be matched up with the groups in the bar charts Group Dendogram Bar Persona 1 cyan green academic 2 blue orange student 3 red purple expert 4 green pink clinician 2.3.1 Expert general background Works as a data scienctist or analysist. relevant prior knowledge or experience Uses programming languages daily to get their work done. Has created analysies, reports, dashboards, and other data products in the past. the learner’s perception of their needs Wants more advanced coding, data management, and data pipeline skills. Quick cheatsheets and reference materials to understand the syntax of how things can be done any special considerations 2.3.2 Clinician general background Works as a medical practitioner. relevant prior knowledge or experience Keeps up with the literature and medical research, but has done little to no experience in doing medical research. Mainly uses Excel for non data related tasks (e.g., making lists), or manually inputing data into spreadsheets. the learner’s perception of their needs Wants to be able to collect and manage data as well as learn about the process behind data analysis to perform own analysis one day. Hands-on workshops allow them to block off time in their work schedule and focus learning and practicing new topics Slides and reference materials to review after the workshop is over any special considerations 2.3.3 Academic general background Academic researcher in the biomedical sciences. relevant prior knowledge or experience May have taken a programming class in the past. Works with data and performs analysis for research. Mainly uses GUI programs or Excel for data collection and analysis. the learner’s perception of their needs Wants to be able to manage data better Code pipelines integrating Excel workflows Materials that be be used as a reference or read through for more details after the workshop any special considerations 2.3.4 Student general background Current or recently graduated student. relevant prior knowledge or experience Have taken classes with programming and/or data analysis related projects. Knows about how data can be formatted and transformed for various needs. Can usually figure out how to do something, even if it means a lot of Googling and struggling. the learner’s perception of their needs Wants reference materials, with good sets of examples to apply to their own questions. any special considerations 2.4 Pre self-assessment personas 2.4.1 Academic Adapted from rstudio “academic” persona Anne, a professor of bioinformatics, studies molecular dynamics of proteins and protein-protein interactions. She is also responsible for teaching an introduction to research to 100 freshman and sophomore students every year. She also runs a data consulting service through the university library, providing research for those who find the statistics department to be unapproachable. Students complain that the Stats department’s introductory course is too theoretical and requires more programming knowledge than they have. Many students in the department also cannot register for similar classes. Anne, has 10s of students working for her in computational MD simulations and other data analytics projects (e.g., NLP, visualization, GIS) She used to analyze the results with specialized software, but is switching to R/Python (which she taught herself during a sabbatical). She has never taken a programming course, and suffers from impostor syndrome in discussions about things like GitHub and R Markdown. Anne would like to learn more about statistical analysis to support her research, and about tools like Git and R Markdown. She also wants guidance using R/Python to teach her intro research course, which currently uses a mixture of Excel and other tools. Anne is juggling half a dozen responsibilities at work, and doesn’t want to look uninformed in front of her colleagues and students. Needs Anne needs workshops (so that she can allocate focused time) and how-to guides (for her research). She would like ready-to-use lesson material she could remix for her students and some orientation material to demystify jargon (e.g., “pull request”?). Finally, it’s important that she be able to use the same tools in her research as in her teaching in order to amortize learning costs and stay in practice. Hurdles Want to provide technical training to students, but does not have the actual time to teach all the relevant skills 2.4.2 Excel Eric taught —– for several years, and now does —–. He still teaches ——— every year to help people with backgrounds like his. Eric uses Excel to keep track of who is registered for webinars, workshops, and training sessions. He doesn’t think of himself as a programmer, but spends hours creating complicated lookup tables to figure out —–, and so on. Eric knows there are better ways to do what he’s doing, but feels overwhelmed by the blog posts, tweets, and “helpful” recommendations from his colleagues Eric is a single parent; the one evening a week he spends teaching is the only out-of-work time he’s able to take away from family responsibilities. Needs Eric wants an overview that will tell him what laptop-scale data science is all about, what tools to learn first, how they’re going to help him, and where he should look for introductory tutorials. He doesn’t care if these are the best answers so long as they are clear, concise, and consistent. He would also benefit from side-by-side comparisons of Excel and R/Python. Hurdles 2.4.3 Generalist Jenny works for the department of biomedical informatics and does everything from training to installation and administration to building dashboards for the hospital. She is fluent in Spanish and Portuguese as well as English, and much of her work is working on analytics to improve health outcomes at the hospital. Jenny has been using Python and Pandas for several years, and just finished working through “R for Data Science” for the second time in preparation for teaching the tidyverse. She has built a couple of Shiny dashboards for the hospital, and hopes to get a package accepted by CRAN some day. Jenny wants updates on high-value topics (new packages, best practices, improvements, etc). She finds most self-paced tutorials frustrating because they’re answering questions she doesn’t have today. Jenny believes that time is money: every minute she spends learning something new has to pay off sooner rather than later. Needs Jenny wants how-to guides and reference material for her day-to-day work webinars to give her a sense of where the industry is going, and short, intensive online training for very specific topics Hurdle Finding training material and tutorials where she can quickly assess whether a new topic/skill is worth learning 2.4.4 Newbie —– is 18 years old and in the first year of an undergraduate degree in public health. He’s read lots of gushing articles about data science, and was excited by the prospect of learning how to do it, but dropped his CS 101 course after six weeks because nothing made sense. He’s doing better in Anya Academic’s course (which he is taking as an elective), but still spends most of his time copying, pasting, and swearing. —– did well in his high school math classes, and has written custom HTML and CSS to spruce up his MySpace/Xenga/LiveJournal pages in junior high. He has accounts on nine different social media sites, and attends all of his morning classes online. —– wants self-paced tutorials with practice exercises, plus forums where he can ask for help. —– got accepted to a summer internship where he knows he will be working with various data science techniques. But he is reluctant to reveal his ignorance and wants to be as prepared as he can be. Needs —– needs short overviews to orient him and introductory tutorials that include videos or animated GIFs showing exactly how to drive the tools, and that use datasets he can relate to. 2.4.5 Tech Toshi does tech support and systems administration at the hospital with over 1000 staff. While others on his team take care of resetting passwords, he debugs setup issues and figures out why the dashboard is displaying nonsense. (It’s usually something to do with date formatting.) He often winds up writing bits of code from Stack Overflow to glue things together. Toshi speaks Bash, Perl, Python, and dabbles in R and JavaScript. He switches back and forth between Linux, Windows, and Mac every day. He often finds himself running hour-long internal training seminars on how to use compute resources, and would now like to learn some data science to support his users and out of personal interest. He wishes people would take a few hours and learn more about the software they’re using, but in practice, he often only has a 30-minute call in which to diagnose the problem and explain a solution. A growing number of analysts at the hospital are asking for Python/R instllations, and beacuase desktops are locked down (for security), more of his time is being spent on program and package installations. Toshi wants to better understand the type of work being down so he can communicate it to his superiors. Toshi lives in Hawaii, so most of his work is done remotely. Needs Toshi needs examples and reference material for himself that he can paraphrase for the people he is supporting—he knows most of what they cover needs something bite-sized for others to consume. He also needs tutorials he can remix for hour-long internal training webinars that he can also show his superiors. 2.4.6 Leader Lisa is former academic who now has a management position in the hospital, Lisa is now in charge of a ten-person analytics group. She is responsible for getting her team trained and purchasing the tools they need to do their work. Lisa thinks in Perl and Matlab; she used base R to develop models and generate reports several years ago, but was promoted before the tidyverse became popular. Lisa wants to improve her team’s processes, particularly around packaging code and making work more reproducible. The new VP of engineering has also asked her to turn everything into a web service. While all of this is going on, she needs to decide how much budget she needs for new software that she will personally never use. Lisa has to work within a strict training budget, and it can sometimes take months to get approval for off-site training (and even longer for on-site). Needs Lisa needs tutorials, reference material, and how-to guides for everything that isn’t data science, including testing, packaging, and Shiny. Her team is satisfied with the existing tutorials on data manipulation and modeling. 2.4.7 Legacy Larry got a job with a pharmaceutical company the day after he graduated and has been with them through two mergers and an acquisition. He refers to company officers by their first names, and is always happy to explain what they’re doing wrong. He was offered the chance to go to rstudio::conf last year, but gave the spot to one of his younger colleagues because “they’d probably enjoy it more”. Larry has been using SAS for 25 years and regards it as a perfectly fine tool, thank you very much. Larry has never used R, but has decades of experience with statistics, messy data, and reporting. He prefers very structured learning environments and clear objectives, and his most common question, “How would I…” followed by a summary of something he has been doing for years in SAS. Larry is a reluctant learner: he recognizes that he has to learn R now that management has decided to adopt Shiny for all its reporting tools, but with just eight years to go until early retirement, the thought makes him weary. He is very uncomfortable with anything outside his normal working environment: he needs to see how to use an IDE step by step (preferably in a one-on-one tutorial) to get over his paralysis. Needs Larry finds tutorials long-winded (“Just show me what function I need to call!”) or confusing (“Why would they do it that way?”). Cheatsheets showing him how to map his understanding of SAS to equivalent code in R would be his preferred starting point. 2.4.8 Keen Katrin did a Master’s in neuropsychology and a 12-week bootcamp with Insight Data Science before getting a job analyzing logistics for a health care services company. She has a wide range of interests and loves learning new things. Katrin uses R, Python, and SQL daily, and recently talked one of the IT staff into teaching her Docker. She has done several online mini-courses in machine learning. Katrin wants to level up her understanding of just about everything. She needs cookbooks and worked examples to show her how to accomplish specific tasks or to fill in specific gaps in her knowledge. While she is enjoying her new job, Katrin misses the camaraderie of grad school and her Insight fellowship: she prefers learning with others to studying on her own. She recently found out about R-Ladies and has enjoyed the two meetups she has been to. Needs Katrin wants workshops (as an opportunity to meet people) and self-paced lessons (so that she can learn new things on her own). She has a complete set of cheatsheets taped up on her wall, but usually checks Stack Overflow before looking at reference manuals. 2.4.9 Librarian Lynn is a director of data services at the (university) library. She and a few colleagues just got their Carpentries training certification in order to put on more workshops and other training sessions for students and faculty. Her main job at the library is data management and wants to incorporate this into more Carpentry-ispired training. Lynn can use a variety of programming languages and tools to get the data she needs, but her bread-and-butter is SQL. She also does work using Excel when she needs to give data to other researchers and students. Lynn is trying to get all the data generated by researchers to be more open and/or findable. As funding agencies are pushing for more Open Access, the library has provided a service to store and share data so they meet OpenX standards. In order to create a useable database of data, she needs the data and its metadata for each of the datasets. Lynn is spending a lot of time asking for researchers to submit the correct data and metadata information. Sometimes the data is ill-formatted, and other times no metadata is provided. Many times, she is just given the paper manuscript as the metadata for the dataset. Data sharing and management snafu in 3 short acts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2zK3sAtr-4 Needs Lynn needs materials she can use to reduce the amount of times she needs to repeat the same information. She would also like modules she can remix for her Carpentries-inspired workshops Hurdles 2.4.10 Researcher "]
