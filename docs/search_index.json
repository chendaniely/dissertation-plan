["learner-personas.html", "Chapter 2 Learner Personas 2.1 Personas 2.2 Persona backstories", " Chapter 2 Learner Personas From Zagallo 2019: Personas are fictional characters that represent key characteristics from a user population of a specific product, and those personas are based on data from real users of the product (Pruitt and Adlin, 2006). Cooper created and introduced persona methodology to the product design industry to overcome the problem of designs that worked optimally for designers but were ill suited for the user base (Cooper, 1999; Pruitt and Adlin, 2006) Persona methodology draws from ethnography to describe how consumers use products in everyday contexts. Persona methodology also combats a second issue in the product design field: user reports that are informative but too lengthy, detailed, and cumbersome (Pruitt and Adlin, 2006). In contrast, personas communicate user information in robust, compact, easily digestible ways that are engaging. Personas also increase the memorability of data, because they provide characters, similar to the characters in a story (Denning, 2002; Grudin and Pruitt, 2002; Pruitt and Adlin, 2006). Persona methodology personas could capture the key discriminating features found across a large number of instructors. personas could be concrete tools that change agents can refer to during PD planning and implementation. by virtue of communicating information through a fictional human character, personas could evoke empathy in PD providers, a critical element if we intend to create a shared vision of education (Henderson and Dancy, 2011) Learners are different, and any one-size-fits-all approach is likely to have significant limitations. Reflection can sensitize facilitators to the variety of instructors they may be working with and help them prepare to respond. We do not envision personas as a diagnostic tool personas as a way to bring awareness and attention to the diversity that exists in PD settings and to help facilitators side with their own instructors and recognize what they bring to the table personas are fictional characters and should be treated as such. The personas are based on data, manifested in a humanistic form for ease of conveying information. As such, personas should be interpreted similarly to tables, graphs, and other data representations found in the literature 2.1 Personas Definitions (from rstudio learner personas): https://rstudio-education.github.io/learner-personas/ Novice: someone who doesn’t yet have a mental model of some field: as a result, they don’t know what they don’t know. Competent: they know enough to perform routine tasks without heroic effort Expert: if they are able to solve common problems at a glance and harder or more unusual problems reliably. Need: researcher who is domain(expert), stats(novice), programming(expert), data(competent) 2.2 Persona backstories From rstudio personas: general background relevant prior knowledge or experience the learner’s perception of their needs any special considerations 2.2.1 Academic Adapted from rstudio “academic” persona Anne, a professor of bioinformatics, studies molecular dynamics of proteins and protein-protein interactions. She is also responsible for teaching an introduction to research to 100 freshman and sophomore students every year. She also runs a data consulting service through the university library, providing research for those who find the statistics department to be unapproachable. Students complain that the Stats department’s introductory course is too theoretical and requires more programming knowledge than they have. Many students in the department also cannot register for similar classes. Anne, has 10s of students working for her in computational MD simulations and other data analytics projects (e.g., NLP, visualization, GIS) She used to analyze the results with specialized software, but is switching to R/Python (which she taught herself during a sabbatical). She has never taken a programming course, and suffers from impostor syndrome in discussions about things like GitHub and R Markdown. Anne would like to learn more about statistical analysis to support her research, and about tools like Git and R Markdown. She also wants guidance using R/Python to teach her intro research course, which currently uses a mixture of Excel and other tools. Anne is juggling half a dozen responsibilities at work, and doesn’t want to look uninformed in front of her colleagues and students. Needs Anne needs workshops (so that she can allocate focused time) and how-to guides (for her research). She would like ready-to-use lesson material she could remix for her students and some orientation material to demystify jargon (e.g., “pull request”?). Finally, it’s important that she be able to use the same tools in her research as in her teaching in order to amortize learning costs and stay in practice. Hurdles Want to provide technical training to students, but does not have the actual time to teach all the relevant skills 2.2.2 Excel Eric taught —– for several years, and now does —–. He still teaches ——— every year to help people with backgrounds like his. Eric uses Excel to keep track of who is registered for webinars, workshops, and training sessions. He doesn’t think of himself as a programmer, but spends hours creating complicated lookup tables to figure out —–, and so on. Eric knows there are better ways to do what he’s doing, but feels overwhelmed by the blog posts, tweets, and “helpful” recommendations from his colleagues Eric is a single parent; the one evening a week he spends teaching is the only out-of-work time he’s able to take away from family responsibilities. Needs Eric wants an overview that will tell him what laptop-scale data science is all about, what tools to learn first, how they’re going to help him, and where he should look for introductory tutorials. He doesn’t care if these are the best answers so long as they are clear, concise, and consistent. He would also benefit from side-by-side comparisons of Excel and R/Python. Hurdles 2.2.3 Generalist Jenny works for the department of biomedical informatics and does everything from training to installation and administration to building dashboards for the hospital. She is fluent in Spanish and Portuguese as well as English, and much of her work is working on analytics to improve health outcomes at the hospital. Jenny has been using Python and Pandas for several years, and just finished working through “R for Data Science” for the second time in preparation for teaching the tidyverse. She has built a couple of Shiny dashboards for the hospital, and hopes to get a package accepted by CRAN some day. Jenny wants updates on high-value topics (new packages, best practices, improvements, etc). She finds most self-paced tutorials frustrating because they’re answering questions she doesn’t have today. Jenny believes that time is money: every minute she spends learning something new has to pay off sooner rather than later. Needs Jenny wants how-to guides and reference material for her day-to-day work webinars to give her a sense of where the industry is going, and short, intensive online training for very specific topics Hurdle Finding training material and tutorials where she can quickly assess whether a new topic/skill is worth learning 2.2.4 Newbie —– is 18 years old and in the first year of an undergraduate degree in public health. He’s read lots of gushing articles about data science, and was excited by the prospect of learning how to do it, but dropped his CS 101 course after six weeks because nothing made sense. He’s doing better in Anya Academic’s course (which he is taking as an elective), but still spends most of his time copying, pasting, and swearing. —– did well in his high school math classes, and has written custom HTML and CSS to spruce up his MySpace/Xenga/LiveJournal pages in junior high. He has accounts on nine different social media sites, and attends all of his morning classes online. —– wants self-paced tutorials with practice exercises, plus forums where he can ask for help. —– got accepted to a summer internship where he knows he will be working with various data science techniques. But he is reluctant to reveal his ignorance and wants to be as prepared as he can be. Needs —– needs short overviews to orient him and introductory tutorials that include videos or animated GIFs showing exactly how to drive the tools, and that use datasets he can relate to. 2.2.5 Tech Toshi does tech support and systems administration at the hospital with over 1000 staff. While others on his team take care of resetting passwords, he debugs setup issues and figures out why the dashboard is displaying nonsense. (It’s usually something to do with date formatting.) He often winds up writing bits of code from Stack Overflow to glue things together. Toshi speaks Bash, Perl, Python, and dabbles in R and JavaScript. He switches back and forth between Linux, Windows, and Mac every day. He often finds himself running hour-long internal training seminars on how to use compute resources, and would now like to learn some data science to support his users and out of personal interest. He wishes people would take a few hours and learn more about the software they’re using, but in practice, he often only has a 30-minute call in which to diagnose the problem and explain a solution. A growing number of analysts at the hospital are asking for Python/R instllations, and beacuase desktops are locked down (for security), more of his time is being spent on program and package installations. Toshi wants to better understand the type of work being down so he can communicate it to his superiors. Toshi lives in Hawaii, so most of his work is done remotely. Needs Toshi needs examples and reference material for himself that he can paraphrase for the people he is supporting—he knows most of what they cover needs something bite-sized for others to consume. He also needs tutorials he can remix for hour-long internal training webinars that he can also show his superiors. 2.2.6 Leader Lisa is former academic who now has a management position in the hospital, Lisa is now in charge of a ten-person analytics group. She is responsible for getting her team trained and purchasing the tools they need to do their work. Lisa thinks in Perl and Matlab; she used base R to develop models and generate reports several years ago, but was promoted before the tidyverse became popular. Lisa wants to improve her team’s processes, particularly around packaging code and making work more reproducible. The new VP of engineering has also asked her to turn everything into a web service. While all of this is going on, she needs to decide how much budget she needs for new software that she will personally never use. Lisa has to work within a strict training budget, and it can sometimes take months to get approval for off-site training (and even longer for on-site). Needs Lisa needs tutorials, reference material, and how-to guides for everything that isn’t data science, including testing, packaging, and Shiny. Her team is satisfied with the existing tutorials on data manipulation and modeling. 2.2.7 Legacy Larry got a job with a pharmaceutical company the day after he graduated and has been with them through two mergers and an acquisition. He refers to company officers by their first names, and is always happy to explain what they’re doing wrong. He was offered the chance to go to rstudio::conf last year, but gave the spot to one of his younger colleagues because “they’d probably enjoy it more”. Larry has been using SAS for 25 years and regards it as a perfectly fine tool, thank you very much. Larry has never used R, but has decades of experience with statistics, messy data, and reporting. He prefers very structured learning environments and clear objectives, and his most common question, “How would I…” followed by a summary of something he has been doing for years in SAS. Larry is a reluctant learner: he recognizes that he has to learn R now that management has decided to adopt Shiny for all its reporting tools, but with just eight years to go until early retirement, the thought makes him weary. He is very uncomfortable with anything outside his normal working environment: he needs to see how to use an IDE step by step (preferably in a one-on-one tutorial) to get over his paralysis. Needs Larry finds tutorials long-winded (“Just show me what function I need to call!”) or confusing (“Why would they do it that way?”). Cheatsheets showing him how to map his understanding of SAS to equivalent code in R would be his preferred starting point. 2.2.8 Keen Katrin did a Master’s in neuropsychology and a 12-week bootcamp with Insight Data Science before getting a job analyzing logistics for a health care services company. She has a wide range of interests and loves learning new things. Katrin uses R, Python, and SQL daily, and recently talked one of the IT staff into teaching her Docker. She has done several online mini-courses in machine learning. Katrin wants to level up her understanding of just about everything. She needs cookbooks and worked examples to show her how to accomplish specific tasks or to fill in specific gaps in her knowledge. While she is enjoying her new job, Katrin misses the camaraderie of grad school and her Insight fellowship: she prefers learning with others to studying on her own. She recently found out about R-Ladies and has enjoyed the two meetups she has been to. Needs Katrin wants workshops (as an opportunity to meet people) and self-paced lessons (so that she can learn new things on her own). She has a complete set of cheatsheets taped up on her wall, but usually checks Stack Overflow before looking at reference manuals. 2.2.9 Librarian Lynn is a director of data services at the (university) library. She and a few colleagues just got their Carpentries training certification in order to put on more workshops and other training sessions for students and faculty. Her main job at the library is data management and wants to incorporate this into more Carpentry-ispired training. Lynn can use a variety of programming languages and tools to get the data she needs, but her bread-and-butter is SQL. She also does work using Excel when she needs to give data to other researchers and students. Lynn is trying to get all the data generated by researchers to be more open and/or findable. As funding agencies are pushing for more Open Access, the library has provided a service to store and share data so they meet OpenX standards. In order to create a useable database of data, she needs the data and its metadata for each of the datasets. Lynn is spending a lot of time asking for researchers to submit the correct data and metadata information. Sometimes the data is ill-formatted, and other times no metadata is provided. Many times, she is just given the paper manuscript as the metadata for the dataset. Data sharing and management snafu in 3 short acts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2zK3sAtr-4 Needs Lynn needs materials she can use to reduce the amount of times she needs to repeat the same information. She would also like modules she can remix for her Carpentries-inspired workshops Hurdles 2.2.10 Researcher "],

It’s goal is to help classify each student into one of the learner personas. It helps the instructor prepare and cater towards the lesson, and also helps students Means to gather feedback on students’ prior knowledge and skills goal: get range of abilities and experiences for the class Used to calibrate materials and/or provide supplemental materials Help students focus on most important knowledge and skills addressed by the course advantage: easy to construct, score, administer anonymously, low-anxiety for students weakness: students may not accurately assess their abilities (usually people over estimate) Assessments around why they are attending the class/workshop What do they plan to learn What are the types of questions they are trying to answer?

Rationale: Assuming that if attendees have not used a programming language before for analysis, they’ve used spreadsheets I have never used it, or I have tried it but can’t really do anything with it. I have used it as an electronic todo list and planner putting schedules and task deadlines in a single place I’ve used it to store datasets and able to calculate basic aggregate values, such as mean and sums I’ve used data aggregation, pivot tables, formulas, and plotting feature to understand how my data breaks down. I’ve coded up VBA macros and made VOOKUP calls integrating multiple sheets for a simulation task If you were given a dataset (e.g., Excel file, CSV file) and asked to do some preliminary analysis on it, which of these best describe how easily you can accomplish the task?

Very unsatisfied Unsatisfied Neutral Satisfied Very satisfied Not sure Not applicable Never thought about this How do you manage your data and analysis? Rationale: How do they manage work for I don’t do data and/or analysis work My data and analysis are all in excel files, possibly with multiple sheets. I work on carefully time-stamped excel files for my version control and analysis I use some programming language to load in my data sets for analysis, but sometimes modify my original data files when cleaning the data I hold my original data sacred, and only work on it from another program and save out intermediate and final data projects as separate files I have a very specific project structure where data and analysis are kept in separate areas and have a version control system (e.g., Git, SVN) I have version controlled project templates along with build scripts (e.g., Makefile) to reproduce various aspects of the analysis Why are you participating in this workshop?

Load data Do analysis Connect to a database Fit statistical models Create and deploy dashboards Create and deploy web artifacts (websites, blogs, books) Hardware + software projects 8.2 Tidy data Need to formalize my own anecdotes and reflections from teaching into something more academic. Over the years while teaching half day workshops at conferences, I’ve completely shifted tidy data and functions to the very beginning of the materials needed in an intro class. This seems to be the most efficient use of workshop time when students have access to an instructor for questions, while covering the more complicated topics in data processing and programming. Many of the other skills in data cleaning, can be more easily picked up on their own by reading the documentation, or looking at examples. Tidy data principles (https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10) is fundamental to understanding data processing. Since a huge amount of effort is spent cleaning and processing data, understanding what makes data tidy, provides the roadmap on how to clean and process data for data exploration and analysis. This provides a framework for understanding how to collect data, and how to transform data collected in the field. If everyone on the team has an understanding on these principles, then transforming the shape of the data needed for collection, presentation, and analysis, can be easily done between all members in an analysis project. This helps the analyst understand why the data they got was in the shape its in, and helps the field worker understand why so much more time is needed to process data they collected, and smarter decisions can be made throughout the entire process. not only does tidy data principles provide a guide to how to clean data, it’s the gateway to learn all the other required data science skills (e.g., plotting, applying functions, dealing with missing data, etc) This also separates the technical knowledge of working with software with the theoretical knowledge of cleaning data for analysis. Once the theory is understood, it can reduce the learning load needed to pick up the technical programming knowledge. Everything all stems from understanding tidy data. 8.3 Workflow managment 8.3.1 Naming things Jenny bryan probably has the clearest slide deck explaining how to name things: https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files machine readable regular expression and globbing friendly avoid spaces, punctuation, accented characters, case sensitivity easy to compute on deliberate use of delimiters easy to search for files later easy to narrow file lists based on names easy to extract info from file names (e.g., by splitting) human readable name contains info on content connects to concept of slug from semantic URLs plays well with default ordering put something numeric first chronological order logical order ISO 8601 standard for dates left pad other numbers with zeros 8.3.2 Project templates/folder structures https://daniel.rbind.io/2017/05/30/project-templates/ https://daniel.rbind.io/2018/01/23/analysis-based-project-templates/ project | |- data # raw and primary data, are not changed once created | | | |- project_data # subfolder that links to an encrypted data storage container | | | | | |- original # raw data, will not be altered | | |- working # intermediate datasets from src code | + +- final # datasets used in analysis | |- src / # any programmatic code | |- user1 # user1 assigned to the project | +- user2 # user2 assigned to the project | |- output # all output and results from workflows and analyses | |- figures/ # graphs, likely designated for manuscript figures | |- pictures/ # diagrams, images, and other non-graph graphics | +- analysis/ # generated reports for (e.g. rmarkdown output) | |- README.md # the top level description of content | |- Makefile # Makefile, if applicable |- .gitignore # git ignore file +- project.Rproj # RStudio project 8.3.3 Software R: https://github.com/r-lib/rprojroot, https://github.com/r-lib/here Python: https://github.com/chendaniely/pyprojroot 8.4 Learning how to program For data provenance. Doing all the processing in a GUI (Excel is a GUI for data processing), is not easily replicicatble. Excel is a GUI for data. and programming in excel is really programming the GUI, rather than working directly on the data. It adds an additional layer of complexity when you need to manipulate data, since you need to wrangle the GUI itself. There’s already replication crisis in science. One could argue that the findings in medical research are more likely going to affect actual people. Flexibility for life: Languages like R any Python allow the user to learn what they need at the time while still providing the mechanisms to grow as their needs and skills grow.

What are the similarities and differences in desired student outcomes among personas? What are the distinctive ways students approach data science, and the situational barriers they encounter? Each persona should have The person’s general background What they already know What they think they want to do Any special needs they have Main groups of students {#persona-groups} Medical / osteopathic doctors Nurses MD PhD programs Analysis hired to work in the medical field Other health professionals (MPH, DVM) 11.1.1 6-step creation process (Pruitt and Adlin, 2006) Discuss categories of users What user information is important to examine for product design Here, the product is training material (learning objectives), users are attendees/students Operating under the framework of situated learning (Lave and Wenger, 1991; Kelly, 2006) What information about students would best aid development of training materials and learning objectives See #persona-groups what are their motivations? what do the students value? what extent do they invest to data literacy/fluency Process data extracting information, themes, and relationships from user data Strauss and Corbin, 2998 interview coding Table 2 in Zagallo 2019 paper: Themes and theme descriptions used to characterize personas These themes can be used for cluster analysis for persona creation Adapted from Zagallo 2019 Knowledge of students Values: what are important to the students. what should get they get out of it?

We used methods that combine hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis with chi-square values or squared Euclidian distance values and complete or average linkage (DataCamp, Inc., n.d.; Wilks, 2011) For cluster analysis, the number of codes should not be greater than the number of individuals who are being clustered (Aldenderfer and Blashfield, 1984) multiple cluster analyses with different distance and linkage algorithms. Each of these methods leads to a dendro- gram that illustrates possible hierarchical relationships within the data (Arabie et al., 1996) five personas is the maximum number recommended by Pruitt and Adlin (2006) compared multiple dendrograms generated by different algorithm measures to identify common cluster relationships among participant instead of bootstrapping because of low sample size 11.2 Example personas (Zagallo 2019) barriers expressed by all personas, such as concerns about content cover- age or large class sizes with insufficient teaching resources, indi- cate problems in departmental, institutional, and disciplinary cultures (Kezar, 2014; Corbo et al., 2016; Reinholz and Apkar- ian, 2018) 11.2.1 Emma Emma likes learning objectives, because they help her organize the course, but she may not integrate learning objectives into her classroom practice understand the impact of sharing learn- ing objectives with students. Doing so increases students’ learn- ing (Armbruster et al., 2009), motivation and engagement (Armbruster et al., 2009; Winkelmes et al., 2016; Reynolds and Kearns, 2017), metacognition (Levine et al., 2008), and self-reg- ulated use of appropriate study strategies (Simon and Taylor, 2009) learn to use evi- dence-based pedagogies like case-based learning (Borrego et al., 2013) or authentic data-interpretation tasks (Hoskins et al., 2007; Round and Campbell, 2013; Zagallo et al., 2016) that provide real-life problem-solving scenarios science is hard but that an opportunity gap exists within the student population, particularly for women, students of color, and students from lower socioeconomic status backgrounds (Eddy et al., 2014; Ballen et al., 2017), and that evidence-based teaching can help close the opportunity gap (Freeman et al., 2011; Eddy and Hogan, 2014; Ballen et al., 2017) an interest in equity, these facts might help her overcome her focus on sorting and her concern about the “top” students. 11.2.2 Ray teaching practice is similar to Emma’s, but he more greatly values connecting to students and gauging their feelings in real time during class. intrinsic interest in relating to students and teach him concrete ways to cognitively engage students (Chi and Wylie, 2014) greatest barrier appears to be how to scale up personal connections with students in large classes emphasize evidence-based techniques that allow Ray to personally connect with students in large classes, such as using index cards to learn students’ names and call on students by name (Tanner, 2011) 11.2.3 Carmen will thrive when given the chance to work with colleagues to build new lessons that engage students in scientific practice (e.g., Elliott et al., 2016; Pelletreau et al., 2018) facilitators who lead change efforts at the department level, such as the departmen- tal action teams presented by Corbo and colleagues (Corbo et al., 2016), should consider tapping Carmen as a leader. persistence with evidence-based teaching and willingness to tackle barriers could be critical in work that addresses the sys- temic structures for recognizing, rewarding, and incentivizing teaching (Reinholz and Apkarian, 2018) 11.2.4 Beth providing a curriculum about student interest and motivation (Lovelace and Brickman, 2013; Seidel et al., 2015; Jordt et al., 2017). only persona who does not express student motivation and engagement as a PD outcome (Table 3), even though she reports a lot of frustration with students’ lack of engagement. puts such a heavy burden of learning on herself that she may have inadvertently taken a lot of the “fun” out of motivating and engaging students. tremendous leadership potential, yet she may be unlikely to lead because of burnout "],

Using tools like {learnr} with the {gradethis} and {pygradethis} library to create training materials. Pre/post workshop surveys can confirm existing knowledge along with results from the interactive questions in the workshop. Does tailored workshop materials help learners retain knowledge, use the tools, and continue self-learning? Combining all the surveys to determine “efficacy” In more detail: Creating learner personas will create better educational content because they will be more tailored to the needs of the students. Learning how to program data analysis will allow learners to feel like they can do more with their data.
