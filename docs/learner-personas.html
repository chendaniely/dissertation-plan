<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 2</span> Learner Personas</h1>
<p>From Zagallo 2019:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Personas are fictional characters that represent key characteristics
from a user population of a specific product, and those personas are
based on data from real users of the product (Pruitt and Adlin,
2006).</li>
<li>Cooper created and introduced persona methodology to the product
design industry to overcome the problem of designs that worked
optimally for designers but were ill suited for the user base
(Cooper, 1999; Pruitt and Adlin, 2006)</li>
<li>Persona methodology draws from ethnography to describe how
consumers use products in everyday contexts.</li>
<li>Persona methodology also combats a second issue in the product
design field: user reports that are informative but too lengthy,
detailed, and cumbersome (Pruitt and Adlin, 2006).</li>
<li>In contrast, personas communicate user information in robust,
compact, easily digestible ways that are engaging. Personas also
increase the memorability of data, because they provide
characters, similar to the characters in a story (Denning, 2002;
Grudin and Pruitt, 2002; Pruitt and Adlin, 2006).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Persona methodology</li>
</ul>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>personas could capture the key discriminating features found
across a large number of instructors.</li>
<li>personas could be concrete tools that change agents can refer to
during PD planning and implementation.</li>
<li>by virtue of communicating information through a fictional human
character, personas could evoke empathy in PD providers, a
critical element if we intend to create a shared vision of
education (Henderson and Dancy, 2011)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Learners are different, and any one-size-fits-all approach is
likely to have significant limitations.</li>
<li>Reflection can sensitize facilitators to the
variety of instructors they may be working with and help
them prepare to respond.</li>
<li>We do not envision personas as a diagnostic tool
<ul>
<li>personas as a way to bring awareness
and attention to the diversity that exists in PD settings and to
help facilitators side with their own instructors and recognize
what they bring to the table</li>
</ul></li>
<li>personas are
fictional characters and should be treated as such. The personas
are based on data, manifested in a humanistic form for ease of
conveying information. As such, personas should be interpreted
similarly to tables, graphs, and other data representations found
in the literature</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Academic</h3>
<p>Adapted from rstudio “academic” persona</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Anne, a professor of bioinformatics, studies molecular dynamics of proteins and protein-protein interactions.
She is also responsible for teaching an introduction to research to 100 freshman and sophomore students every year.
She also runs a data consulting service through the university library,
providing research for those who find the statistics department to be unapproachable.
Students complain that the Stats department’s introductory course is too theoretical and requires more programming knowledge than they have.
Many students in the department also cannot register for similar classes.</p></li>
<li><p>Anne, has 10s of students working for her in computational MD simulations
and other data analytics projects (e.g., NLP, visualization, GIS)
She used to analyze the results with specialized software, but is switching to R/Python (which she taught herself during a sabbatical).
She has never taken a programming course,
and suffers from impostor syndrome in discussions about things like GitHub and R Markdown.</p></li>
<li><p>Anne would like to learn more about statistical analysis to support her research,
and about tools like Git and R Markdown.
She also wants guidance using R/Python to teach her intro research course,
which currently uses a mixture of Excel and other tools.</p></li>
<li><p>Anne is juggling half a dozen responsibilities at work, and doesn’t want to look uninformed in front of her colleagues and students.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Needs</p>
<ul>
<li>Anne needs workshops (so that she can allocate focused time) and how-to guides (for her research).</li>
<li>She would like ready-to-use lesson material she could remix for her students and some orientation material to demystify jargon (e.g., “pull request”?).</li>
<li>Finally, it’s important that she be able to use the same tools in her research as in her teaching in order to amortize learning costs and stay in practice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hurdles</p>
<ul>
<li>Want to provide technical training to students, but does not have the actual time to teach all the relevant skills</li>
</ul>

While others on his team take care of resetting passwords, he debugs setup issues and figures out why the dashboard is displaying nonsense.

He often winds up writing bits of code from Stack Overflow to glue things together.</p></li>

He switches back and forth between Linux, Windows, and Mac every day.
He often finds himself running hour-long internal training seminars on how to use compute resources,
and would now like to learn some data science to support his users and out of personal interest.
He wishes people would take a few hours and learn more about the software they’re using,
but in practice, he often only has a 30-minute call in which to diagnose the problem and explain a solution.</p></li>

He refers to company officers by their first names, and is always happy to explain what they’re doing wrong.
He was offered the chance to go to rstudio::conf last year,
but gave the spot to one of his younger colleagues because “they’d probably enjoy it more”.</p></li>

<li><p>Larry has never used R, but has decades of experience with statistics, messy data, and reporting.
He prefers very structured learning environments and clear objectives, and his most common question,
“How would I…” followed by a summary of something he has been doing for years in SAS.</p></li>
<li><p>Larry is a reluctant learner:
he recognizes that he has to learn R now that management has decided to adopt Shiny for all its reporting tools,
but with just eight years to go until early retirement, the thought makes him weary.
He is very uncomfortable with anything outside his normal working environment:
he needs to see how to use an IDE step by step (preferably in a one-on-one tutorial) to get over his paralysis.</p></li>

As funding agencies are pushing for more Open Access,
the library has provided a service to store and share data so they meet OpenX standards.
In order to create a useable database of data,
she needs the data and its metadata for each of the datasets.</p></li>
<li><p>Lynn is spending a lot of time asking for researchers to submit the correct data and metadata information.
Sometimes the data is ill-formatted, and other times no metadata is provided.
Many times, she is just given the paper manuscript as the metadata for the dataset.</p></li>
